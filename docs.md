### *"Black American history prepares black people to believe that true history is hidden and destroyed, or that history results from a logical bundling of lies that mutilate and kill. We have been prepared, by our American experience, to believe that civilization festers between opposite poles of plunder and pain. And still the university waits, unavoidable  at the end of compulsory education, to assure the undisturbed perpetuity of this civilization."*

June Jordan, 1971
